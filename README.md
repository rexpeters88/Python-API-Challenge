# python-api-challenge

Both Jupyter notebooks (WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb) are located in the WeatherPy folder on the main branch. The output data is stored in a separate folder within the WeatherPy folder named "output_data"


Sources:
1) ChatGBT: IN[23] - demonstrated how to implement label within matplotlib in order to more astetically display linear regression line
2) Xpert: Vacation.py IN[20] - hotel_df = ideal_weather_df[["City", "Country", "Lat", "Lng", "Humidity"]].copy() - use of .copy() was neccesary to implement proper new dataframe and subsequently create blank column
